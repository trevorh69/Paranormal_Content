          <a href="General videos">General videos</a>, and our pics. General videos are
          exactly what it says. it is the page whereall the paranormal videos
          that we either find or people send us. then there is<a href="Top pics">
          Top pics</a>. A top pic is a place we the creators put the videos
          that we find or people send us that we find to be credible videos.

        <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>We the creators made this site because we were tired of searching
            through hundreds of videos to find good paranormal content. On most
            populer media platforms, there are long compilation videos with
            narration overlayed. We find that to be utter bullshit. Our job is
            to give you video as is and unedited.</p>
